## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone or Extract the Project

```bash
cd c:\xampp\htdocs\rscpl\rscpl
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
composer install
```

### 3. Environment Configuration

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:

```bash
copy .env.example .env
```

Generate application key:

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

### 4. Database Configuration

Edit your `.env` file and configure your database settings:

```env
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=rscpl
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
```

Create the database (if not exists):

```sql
CREATE DATABASE rscpl CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
```

### 5. Run Migrations

Run the database migrations to create the `contacts` table:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

This will create the following table:
- `contacts` - Stores contact form submissions

### 6. Mail Configuration

Configure your mail settings in `.env` for contact form email notifications:

#### Using Gmail (Example):

```env
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME=your-email@gmail.com
MAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=your-email@gmail.com
MAIL_FROM_NAME="${APP_NAME}"
```

**Note**: For Gmail, you need to use an [App Password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833).
